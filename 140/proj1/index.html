        <p>I am a student in the Networking and Systems Administration program at
            Rochester Institute of Technology. I have a very strong and passionate
            interest in Linux and the free and open source software community.
            I have been using varying distributions of Linux for roughly 6 years.
            I am currently using Red Hat based Fedora Linux as a primary OS and CentOS 7
            as a secondary operating system.</p>

        <p>I hope that this site is useful to potential employers as both a resource
            for information about me as well as a demonstration of my skills.</p>

                Switched majors from Computer Science after my first
                year when I further clarified my interests and career aspirations and
                realized that my interest was more of the practical side of coding and
                less of the process to solve a problem. My new major also fits well with
                my hobbies and activities outside of classes. I spend much of my free time
                configuring, maintaining and experimenting with various operating systems
                whether virtualized or locally installed.

    		<p>
    		I am very passionate about Linux and opensource software and the associated community.
    		I also enjoy messing around with virtual machines of old operating systems to see what I can make them do.
    		In terms of pets, I am a dog person. I am unfortunately, allergic to cats.
    		I enjoy hiking and being out in nature when I am not in school or working with my computer.
    		Finally, though I am several generations from being a native of Ireland, I am very proud to have it as half of my heritage.
