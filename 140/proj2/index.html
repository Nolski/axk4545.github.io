    Linux is a free and opensource operating system created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 during his time as a student at the University of Helsinki in Helsinki Finland. Torvalds was frustrated by the limited capabilities of the copy of MS-DOS provided with his new 486 PC. While a free UNIX like operating system did exist at the time the license terms for it were too restrictive for his purposes. It has since gained popularity as a server and embedded OS.

    Below is the message from the comp.os.minix newsgroup written by Torvalds in 1991 announcing the creation of Linux:

    Hello everybody out there using minix -
    <br>
    <p>
    I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
    professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.  This has been brewing
    since april, and is starting to get ready.  I'd like any feedback on
    things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat
    (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)
    among other things).
    </p>
    <p>
    I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
    This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and
    I'd like to know what features most people would want.  Any suggestions
    are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
    </p>

    PS.  Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
    It is NOT [portable] (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
    will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.
