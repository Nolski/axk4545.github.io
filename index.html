        <p>I am a student in the Networking and Systems Administration program at
            Rochester Institute of Technology. I have a very strong and passionate
            interest in Linux and the free and open source software community.
            I have been using varying distributions of Linux for roughly 6 years.
            I am currently using Red Hat based Fedora Linux as a primary OS and CentOS 7
            as a secondary operating system.</p>

        <p>I hope that this site is useful to potential employers as both a resource
            for information about me as well as a demonstration of my skills.</p>
