  </a>
  <p>Built in 1915 as a terminal for passenger and freight traffic on Lake Michigan and public events, the pier was used as a training facility by the United States Navy during World War II.  
  The pier was converted into it's current state as a mix of shopping, dining, entertainment and outdoor space. 
  The most prominent feature of the pier is the ferris wheel. The current one, installed in May 2016, is 196 feet tall.</p>

  <p>Known commonly as The Bean for its kidney bean like shape, this sculpture was designed by British artist Anish Kapoor.The sculpture is designed to reflect a distorted image of the Chicago skyline.</p>

  </a>
  <p>The Sears Tower was built in 1973 as the Chicago headquarters of retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company. Sears wished to consolidate their Chicago employees into the 108 story structure.
  On a clear day, you can see across Lake Michigan to Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin from the skydeck observation deck on the 103rd floor.</p>
  
  <h2>Buckingham Fountain</h2>
  <a title="Kkmd at the English language Wikipedia [GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html) or CC-BY-SA-3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)], via Wikimedia Commons" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ABuckingham_Fountain_in_Chicago_at_night.jpg">

  </a>
  <p>Buckingham Fountain was donated to the city by Kate Buckingham as a memorial to her brother Clarence. It was dedicated on August 26th, 1927. 
  Both Kate and Clarence were patrons of the arts so it is a fitting memorial. The central jet can shoot water 150 feet into the air.</p>
