  This was the sart of his mail order catalog business. The catalogs would be mailed to rural homes and orders were then sent back to the Ward headquaters in Chicago and the order was delivered to the customers nearest rail station.
  When Grant Park on the Chicago lake front was threatened by the city's continued expansion, Ward sued to keep the the lake shore, "Public Ground -- A Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear, and Free of Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction, Whatever"
